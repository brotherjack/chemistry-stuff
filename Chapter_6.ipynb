    "\n",
    "## What & Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically I'm hoping to do three things with this, namely:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This is an exercise in maintaining and expaning my skill set in Julia programing, LaTeX typesetting, and usage of jupyter notebooks. These skills are definitely important in working with science programing. Even if there is nothing computationally complex here, I can keep these skills sharp and develop them as the material I'm studying gets more complex.\n",
    "2. I can share what I'm working on and how I'm approaching it. This is also good practice for managing more complex data. One of the most important things in data analysis is maintaining a _chain of custody_. While this also refers to managing who collects data and how, it also covers how data is manipulated, cleaned, and otherwise transformed. A jupyter notebook is a great tool for this.\n",
    "3. I can check my calculations algorithmically. While none of these calculations are particularly difficult, they can become messy with paper and pen, and I am prone to transcription errors. While the first two points are far more important, this isn't without some importance. Also, I can prototype relationships and draw plots, which could be helpful as long as I don't spend too much time working on this and not the actual material.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that I probably spent too much time today on this. However, much of this was on tooling and set up. As long as my pace picks up, I think this small investment will pay off in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OK, what should I do with this?\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't really have to do anything with this. You can chose to ignore it completely. You can dive into the code if you really want to, but it would probably be best to just ignore that. You can tell the difference between the \"cells\" that are programming code and those that are the markdown code (which this cell is, and has the actual human-specific stuff) by the presence of `In [#]:`. That prefix indicates that the cell is programming input, you can see the output beneath it in a cell called `Out[#]:`, every cell that doesn't have these prefixes are what is for presentation.\n",
